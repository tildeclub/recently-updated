# Recently-Updated Page Shell Scripts

As soon as [~ford](http://tilde.club/~ford) granted me entrance to tilde.Club, I knew that I wanted to keep tabs on what cool things folks were doing there. And thinking back to the mid-90s, what was the best way to know what was new on a site? A recently-updated page! So I set about making one for tilde.club.

There's no question at all that this is a rudimentary hack, but it's the *exact* sort of hack that was The Way To Do Things on the mid-90s Internet. (Note that that's the mid-90s-capital-I-Internet, not the [21st-century-lowercase-i-internet](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/weekinreview/29SCHW.html).) And I'm using tried-and-true command-line Unix filesystem commands to grab, parse, and sort the list of pages, so I feel like I'm treading in the footsteps of thousands before me. The result is [the list of all tilde.club pages updated in the last 24 hours](http://tilde.club/~delfuego/tilde.24h.html), which is generated from the ```findmod.sh``` shell script once a minute from a crontab job.

Of course, while the HTML version of the recently-updated list is firmly mid-90s (well, if you view source you'll see that it's 21st-century HTML5, but still), enabling cooler 21st-century functionality required making the same list available in a more easily-parsed format. Enter JSON, and the [API version of the recently-updated list](http://tilde.club/~delfuego/tilde.24h.json), generated by the ```findmod-json.sh``` shell script once a minute via crontab as well.

Hope these are useful to someone!
